# Discovery Starter Theme

This is the repository for the search service "starter" theme. This theme is used as a starting point for adding the search service to your project.

## Installation

```sh
composer require silverstripeltd/discovery-theme
```

## Documentation

This theme is to be used with the search service discovery module and tries to be a basic implementation and agnostic enough to not get in the way of your existing sites.

Once you have implemented the SearchResults page in your application move or rename the SearchResults.ss file in this theme to the correct namespace.
